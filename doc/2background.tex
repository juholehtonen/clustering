positioned in the larger field of machine learning. But first we
describe what bibliometrics is.

\section{Bibliometrics}
\label{sec:bibliometrics}
% Mita bibliometriikka on?
% Valmis --->-v
Bibliometrics is a study of written scientific records. The 
records may be books, articles, letters in scientific journals, 
conference papers and so on. Bibliometrics studies how these 
products of research are communicated, how are they related to 
each other, what kind of properties they have and what can be 
learned about the science in general by analysing them.

% Mihin bibliometriikka pyrkii vastaamaan?
Bibliometrics seeks to answer questions like ``How many 
publications has an author authored?'', ``How many citations an 
author has'', ``What are the 
cited publications of a scientific document?''. It also studies
a bit more broader questions like ``How many publications there 
has been published on a discipline X a year?'', ``Which research area
does this publication belong to?'', ``What other publications 
belong to this research area?'', ``When has this research area
emerged?'', ``What are the most important related research areas
of this discipline?'' and so 
on.\cite{pritchard_statistical_1969}\cite{broadus_toward_1987}

Classifying things is often the first thing we do when we observe 
the world. On the other hand, counting the frequencies of objects
and comparing these numbers often helps to put things in 
perspective.

One of the earliest studies that is generally considered
bibliometrics was Cole's and Eales' analysis to the anatomy 
literature in 1917 \cite{cole_history_1917}. In their study they 
researched the anatomy literature from 1543 through 1860 with the 
intention to graph the growth of the number of documents over 
the three centuries, to present ``the performance'' of each 
European country, to observe the most popular topics among 
scholars from time to time, and to compare the advancement and 
devolution stages of the research with different societal 
events \cite{bellis_bibliometrics_2009}.
As the number of scientific publications has enormously increased
the need to automatically analyse them has become apparent.
The basic analysis on top of which more detailed studies can be 
built on is classifying each publication to research areas and
disciplines.
% The need for some kind of bibliometric indices rise in the

% indexing/publishing/to facilitate communication...
% At some point more and more automation was needed for bibliomterics
% There has been lot of study in automatically classificating the

\subsection{Classification in bibliometrics}
% Specific charasteristics of classifying the bibliometrics
% Miten bibliometriikkaa voidaan jasentaa / mista se koostuu?
% Existing classification systems / methods
% =========================================
% \fixme{Onko Scopus tässä relevantti jos ei Scopus-dataa?}
Currently, the most popular systems to classify the publications 
into research areas are Clarivate's (formerly Thomson Reuters)
Web of Science\footnote{https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/} 
and Elsevier's Scopus\footnote{https://www.scopus.com/} classification
systems. These classification systems classify journals into
one or more research areas \cite{waltman_new_2012}. Publications
are then classified to research areas based on in which journal they
were published. WoS uses approximately 250 \emph{subject categories}
in its classification. Each journal can belong 
to one or up to six categories. The categories have been created
latest on early 1960's by manually classifying journals.
New journals were added one at the time after visual inspection of
citation information. New categories were added when old ones
grew \cite{pudovkin_algorithmic_2002}. As for Scopus, according to 
Wang and Waltman \cite{wang_large-scale_2016}, ``there seems to be no 
information at all on the construction of its classification 
system''. We will use the data from WoS database in this work.

% Journal level classification
Also an independent journal level classification system has been 
developed \cite{archambault_towards_2011}.
Journal level classification systems have known limitations.
They are, for example, unable to meaningfully classify
publications published in multi-discipline journals.
Also some discipline specific classification systems exists such 
as Association for Computing Machinery's Computing Classification 
System for computer science discipline \cite{noauthor_2012_2020}, 
the U.S. National Library
of Medicine Classification \cite{noauthor_national_2020} for medical 
resources and American Physical Society's Physics Subject Headings
\cite{noauthor_american_2020} for physics publications for example.
% Publication level classification 
An alternative classification system is publication level 
classification where each publication is classified based on some 
information extracted directly from the publication self. Commonly 
used information is the title, the abstract, keywords attached by
the authors or the publisher and citations to other publications.
Shu et al. have compared journal and paper level classification
approaches and found that publication level classification could
provide better classification \cite{shu_comparing_2019}.
% Usually classification of publications or journals can be approached 
% at least from multiple directions. There is clustering based method,
% the network based method and the combination of the two.

Bibliometric research uses mainly three types of methods for 
journal or publication level classification; citation 
based, text analysis based or combination of the two 
\cite{janssens_hybrid_2009}. Citation based methods study 
citations of publications and produce networks where publications 
are nodes connected by citations as edges. In the rare case of 
publication having a direct quote including a citation, the 
citation is not counted unless it is also a citation of the 
publication itself. Connection between two publications can be 
formed by a direct citation, bibliometric coupling where 
publications are connected when a third publication cites them 
both or co-citations where publications are connected if they 
cite the same third publication.

Text analysis based methods can examine for example the title, the 
abstract or the whole text content of the publication itself and 
classify the publications or journals by the topic model created 
\cite{blei_latent_2003}.
Hybrid models combine both approaches. 
% TODO: Tämä pois?
Authors and their affiliations are not used in this work because 
we cannot uniquely identify them and we can not assume their field 
of science that is our interest here.
Classifying publications into scientific disciplines is an open
problem and a subject of active research. Currently there is no 
known general, good enough practical solution.


\subsection{Bibliometrics in Finland}
Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland provides yearly
updated bibliometric analyses of Finnish research activities 
based on both Web Of Science citation index 
and Elsevier's Scopus database \cite[Vipunen 
service]{noauthor_ministry_2020}. The corresponding source 
system classification for a field of science is used and
aggregated to match the Statistics Finland classification 
\cite{auranen_tieteen_2018}. CSC - 
IT Center for Science is responsible of the actual technical 
implementation of the service.

One of the earlier and comprehensive bibliometric research of 
Finnish science is a report by Persson et al. 
\cite{persson_bibliometric_2000} which mapped the situation and 
development of Finnish science 1981-1998.
This, however, is a report which concentrates on bibliometric 
analysis based on the map of science provided by WoS subject 
categories. But if we want to explore how the Finnish scientific 
disciplines themselves have evolved over time these pre-defined 
subject categories are quite a rigid framework. For that reason we 
want to experiment creating an alternative mapping of science by 
clustering. 
So, as opposed to bibliometric analyses seeking to understand the
state of a scientific discipline as defined by some existing 
definition, we want to experiment and inspect how to define 
scientific disciplines to be used in bibliometric analyses.

%Efforts to cluster Finnish research include a study by...

Suominen and Toivanen \cite{suominen_map_2016} used unsupervised learning-based topic 
modelling to create a map of science for Finnish publications from 
1995-2011. They evaluated it by comparing the results with WoS 
based classification and concluded that superiority of the method
depends on the purpose of the analysis. Traditional manually created 
classifications are relevant for information retrieval while 
machine learning methods can reveal new emerging areas of science.
Compared to our work here, their 
analysis method topic modelling differs from hierarchical 
clustering albeit both are unsupervised learning methods.
% \fixme{We will return to compare our results to those of
% Suominen and Toivanen in Discussion chapter.}

Our research question here is: \emph{"How to automatically cluster 
Finnish scientific publications and how does that clustering 
compare to existing fields of science classification by WoS?"} We 
will use hierarchical clustering on features derived from titles,
abstracts and keywords in publication meta data.


\section{Clustering}
The methods discussed in this work belong to the field of machine 
learning. The field has its roots in statistics and engineering 
and is itself part of artificial intelligence, a sub-field of 
computer science.
The methods in machine learning can be divided to \emph{supervised}, 
\emph{unsupervised} and \emph{reinforced learning}
\cite{alpaydin2004introduction}.

Commonly for all methods we define $X$ as
the sample data and $Y$ as label indicating which class our data 
sample $X$ belongs. We also have to choose the model $f()$ for
learning from the data. Then we can state our learning problem as
a function $Y = f(w \cdot X)$, where $w$ is a weight vector, 
which would give a prediction of the class $Y$ of the sample data
$X$. 
Assuming we have enough of samples $X$ we then teach our model 
with training data. That is, we solve the weights $w$ using the
loss function such that it optimizes the difference between the 
true and the predicted class labels $Y$.

Supervised learning methods include classification and continuous 
estimation (regression)
where the class of the training samples, or the target values in 
case of regression, $Y$ is known. Example of a classification 
problem is optical character recognition where the system is 
taught with example of characters along with their correct labels.

For unsupervised learning the correct answer or the label $Y$ is not known. 
Instead a model is applied such that it finds regularities in the
input data $X$. Example of unsupervised learning problem is 
finding anomalies that do not fit in the group, such as analysing
log files of a computer system to find a possible intruder.

Unsupervised learning methods include clustering, dimensionality
reduction and topic modelling for instance. By clustering we try to 
distinguish patterns in the data and discriminate unrelated 
objects into separate clusters and aggregate related objects into
same cluster.

In reinforced learning we want the system to learn a sequence of
actions leading to desired outcome. For example we may want the 
system to learn to win a game. In that case individual actions
are not important but the end result as there are many ways to win
a game. So the system repeatedly tries different combinations of
actions while it receives the result of its combined actions.
