This thesis handles the problem of clustering Finnish scientific 
publications by their metadata. The target is to cluster 
them as well as possible by their scientific discipline. Of course 
the ``wellness'' of a clustering measured by how it fits to 
scientific fields is a tricky issue for at least couple of reasons.

First, there is no general consensus about what is the correct 
partition of all science to different branches. It might be depend 
on specific need or individual opinion where the line between two 
related discipline lies.

Second, science is evolving all the time. What was yesterday seen 
simply as chemistry could today be viewed as organic and inorganic 
chemistry.

Third, the definition of scientific diciplines depends also how 
closely we look into a topic. Sometimes chemistry is sufficent 
description for eg. a publication and sometimes we need to define 
it more accurately to organic chemistry.

But despite this ambiguousness of the target we define and 
justify some goals and how to measure our success.


In Finland there are 15 universities and 23(+2) universities of 
applied sciences. Additionally there are 12 research institutes.
Each year the whole of Finnish scientific efforts produce about 
10000 publications in whole scope of scientific spectrum. 
\fixme{10000 tulee siis WOS ja Elsevierilta} The Ministry of 
Education and Culture oversees what is researched and in what 
quanities in the Finnish research.
Classifying articles by discipline enables different types of 
bibliometric analysis.
% It is also ill posed problem because there is no one right answer
% for the problem. Different tasks require different classification.
Because of the amount of the scientific articles manual 
classification is not applicable. \fixme{Also: kukaan tuskin 
pystyy hallitsemaan kaikkia tieteenaloja. Tavoitteena tyokalu, 
jolla analyysin tekija voi luokitella }

\fixme{When bibliometric started?}
There has been lot of study in automatically classificating the 
science.
First classifications...
% were made by romans/greeks/sumerians... 
% The whole field of science was comprehended differently then.
The need for some kind of bibliometric indices rise in the 
First modern(?) classification was... by... some 
indexing/publishing/to facilitate communication...

% All these are manual methods. Automatic methods are needed.... 
Automatic methods shouldbe able to label the article by some 
criterion to the (subjectively) obvious discipline. The input for 
automatic method can usually at most be the whole article and 
perhaps some metadata describing it. The metadata can be from the 
author or publisher or some archive.

\fixme{What methods used?}
Different methods have been suggested. NN1 suggested SOME METHOD. 
NN2 suggested SOME OTHER METHOD. NN3 suggested YET A METHOD.

In this thesis we will try to cluster Finnish publications by 
discipline by using the metadata.
