% The goal
% ==========
This thesis handles the problem of clustering Finnish scientific 
publications by their metadata. The goal is to cluster 
them as well as possible by their scientific discipline. We want 
to find a clustering for the publications such that it matches 
as well as possible an imaginary average manual classification 
done by human experts.

% Why this goal is needed?
% ========================
Classifying articles by discipline enables different types of 
bibliometric analyses. Such classifications can be used in 
summarizing research output of a university or a country.
The sum of all scientific publication of eg. an individual country can be 
interesting and useful information that can tell something about 
research and its level in that country.

% kansallisten koulutuspäätösten tueksi tarvitsee bibliometriikka.
%In Finland the ministry of education and culture uses such 
%information to follow what is researched and in what quanities in
%the Finnish academia.

We use Finnish scientific publications from  Web of Science (WoS)
database as our source data. 
Web of Science database gets approximately 10000 publications 
annually that can be assigned as a result of Finnish research (see 
\ref{tt2018} for definition).

It should be noted that not all Finnish research can be found from
WoS database. Especially humanities and social sciences are 
underrepresented so it isn't comprehensive image of Finnish 
research.
% It is also ill posed problem because there is no one right answer
% for the problem. Different tasks require different classification.
Due to the amount of the scientific articles, manual 
classification is not applicable. It is also impossible for any 
one person to master all fields of science to manage such a
task. Our goal is a method that the analyst herself can apply.
% Environment/background/context
% ==============================

% In Finland there are 13 universities, 12 state research institutes,
% and 24 universities of applied sciences. Additionally there are 
% other instances like military academy and private companies that 
% contribute to research. 
For clustering we will use metadata that the authors will provide
with the publication in any case (title, abstract, keywords).

Clustering will not produce any labels for the clusters. They must
be labeled appropriately by other means. We will label the 
produced clusters using the top five most significant terms of a 
cluster.

The ``wellness'' of a clustering measured by how it fits to 
scientific fields is a tricky issue for at least couple of 
reasons.
% Obstacles
% =========
First, there is no general consensus about what is the correct 
partition of all science to its different branches. Or even what
are the different fields of science. It might depend 
on specific need or individual opinion where the line between two 
related discipline lies.

Second, science is evolving all the time. What was yesterday seen 
simply as chemistry could today be viewed as organic and inorganic 
chemistry.

Third, the definition of scientific disciplines depends also how 
closely we look into a topic. Sometimes chemistry is sufficent 
classification for eg. a publication and sometimes we need to label 
it more accurately as organic chemistry.

Fourth, there is a considerable amount of research that is 
intrinsically cross-disciplinary. For example bioinformatics relies
heavily on biology and computer science. So it depends on the 
purpose whether a publication should be considered belonging to
biology, computer science, bioinformatics or to all of them.

We will measure the resulting clustering by comparing it to the
existing Web of Science classification. The clustering is good if
it in outline matches WoS classification.
% ...mutta kenties tarkentaa sitä ryvästämällä jotkut julkaisut 
% pienempiin ryppäisiin samankaltaisten julkaisujen kanssa.
% But despite this ambiguousness of the target we define and 
% justify some goals and how to measure our success.


% All these are manual methods. Automatic methods are needed...
% Automatic methods should be able to label the article by some 
% criterion to the (subjectively) obvious discipline. The input for 
% automatic method can usually at most be the whole article and 
% perhaps some metadata describing it. The metadata can be 
% created by the author or the publisher or some archive.

% \fixme{What methods used?}
% Different methods have been suggested. NN1 suggested SOME METHOD. 
% NN2 suggested SOME OTHER METHOD. NN3 suggested YET A METHOD.
