	abstract = {We survey agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms and discuss efficient implementations that are available in R and other software environments. We look at hierarchical self-organizing maps, and mixture models. We review grid-based clustering, focusing on hierarchical density-based approaches. Finally we describe a recently developed very efficient (linear time) hierarchical clustering algorithm, which can also be viewed as a hierarchical grid-based algorithm.},

	abstract = {computer-based system for automatically classifying scientific articles is described. The unique feature of this system is that its structure is completely determined by citation patterns in the Science Citation Index. These citation patterns give rise to clusters or clumps of cited papers which correspond, in turn, to clusters of citing papers. Classificatioll headings for each cluster  are determined by examination of high frequency word pairs drawn from the titles of the citing papers. Classification of a New article is performed automatically by determining what clusters it cites and assigning appropriate (weighted) subject headings to it. The system will permit updating of the classification scheme Oil wilh annual basis, and the incorporation of new headings and deletion of old ones.},

	abstract = {Search facilitated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods was studied in a collection of Finnish newspaper articles (N = 53,893). To allow quick experiments, clustering was applied to a sample (N = 5,000) that was reduced with principal components analysis. The dendrograms were heuristically cut to find an optimal partition, whose clusters were compared with each of the 30 queries to retrieve the best-matching cluster. The four-level relevance assessment was collapsed into a binary one by (A) considering all the relevant and (B) only the highly relevant documents relevant, respectively. Single linkage (SL) was the worst method. It created many tiny clusters, and, consequently, searches enabled with it had high precision and low recall. The complete linkage (CL), average linkage (AL), and Ward's methods (WM) returned reasonably-sized clusters typically of 18–32 documents. Their recall (A: 27–52\%, B: 50–82\%) and precision (A: 83–90\%, B: 18–21\%) was higher than and comparable to those of the SL clusters, respectively. The AL and WM clustering had 1–8\% better effectiveness than nearest neighbor searching (NN), and SL and CL were 1–9\% less efficient that NN. However, the differences were statistically insignificant. When evaluated with the liberal assessment A, the results suggest that the AL and WM clustering offer better retrieval ability than NN. Assessment B renders the AL and WM clustering better than NN, when recall is considered more important than precision. The results imply that collections in the highly inflectional and agglutinative languages, such as Finnish, may be clustered as the collections in English, provided that documents are appropriately preprocessed.},
