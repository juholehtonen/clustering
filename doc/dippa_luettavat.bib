	abstract = {computer-based system for automatically classifying scientific articles is described. The unique feature of this system is that its structure is completely determined by citation patterns in the Science Citation Index. These citation patterns give rise to clusters or clumps of cited papers which correspond, in turn, to clusters of citing papers. Classificatioll headings for each cluster  are determined by examination of high frequency word pairs drawn from the titles of the citing papers. Classification of a New article is performed automatically by determining what clusters it cites and assigning appropriate (weighted) subject headings to it. The system will permit updating of the classification scheme Oil wilh annual basis, and the incorporation of new headings and deletion of old ones.},

	abstract = {The delineation of coordinates is fundamental for the cartography of science, and accurate and credible classification of scientific knowledge presents a persistent challenge in this regard. We present a map of Finnish science based on unsupervised-learning classification, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach vis-à-vis those generated by human reasoning. We conclude that from theoretical and practical perspectives there exist several challenges for human reasoning-based classification frameworks of scientific knowledge, as they typically try to fit new-to-the-world knowledge into historical models of scientific knowledge, and cannot easily be deployed for new large-scale data sets. Automated classification schemes, in contrast, generate classification models only from the available text corpus, thereby identifying credibly novel bodies of knowledge. They also lend themselves to versatile large-scale data analysis, and enable a range of Big Data possibilities. However, we also argue that it is neither possible nor fruitful to declare one or another method a superior approach in terms of realism to classify scientific knowledge, and we believe that the merits of each approach are dependent on the practical objectives of analysis.},

	abstract = {A hybrid text/citation-based method is used to cluster journals covered by the Web of Science database in the period 2002–2006. The objective is to use this clustering to validate and, if possible, to improve existing journal-based subject-classification schemes. Cross-citation links are determined on an item-by-paper procedure for individual papers assigned to the corresponding journal. Text mining for the textual component is based on the same principle; textual characteristics of individual papers are attributed to the journals in which they have been published. In a first step, the 22-field subject-classification scheme of the Essential Science Indicators (ESI) is evaluated and visualised. In a second step, the hybrid clustering method is applied to classify the about 8300 journals meeting the selection criteria concerning continuity, size and impact. The hybrid method proves superior to its two components when applied separately. The choice of 22 clusters also allows a direct field-to-cluster comparison, and we substantiate that the science areas resulting from cluster analysis form a more coherent structure than the “intellectual” reference scheme, the ESI subject scheme. Moreover, the textual component of the hybrid method allows labelling the clusters using cognitive characteristics, while the citation component allows visualising the cross-citation graph and determining representative journals suggested by the PageRank algorithm. Finally, the analysis of journal ‘migration’ allows the improvement of existing classification schemes on the basis of the concordance between fields and clusters.},

Forty-three articles, published in the journal Information Retrieval, are used as test documents. We investigate how well the approaches agree with a ground truth subject classification of the test documents, when the complete linkage method is used, and under two types of similarities, first-order and second-order. The results show that it is possible to achieve a very good approximation of the classification by means of automatic grouping of articles. One text-only method and one combination method, under second-order similarities in both cases, give rise to cluster solutions that to a large extent agree with the classification.},

	abstract = {Background We investigate the accuracy of different similarity approaches for clustering over two million biomedical documents. Clustering large sets of text documents is important for a variety of information needs and applications such as collection management and navigation, summary and analysis. The few comparisons of clustering results from different similarity approaches have focused on small literature sets and have given conflicting results. Our study was designed to seek a robust answer to the question of which similarity approach would generate the most coherent clusters of a biomedical literature set of over two million documents. Methodology We used a corpus of 2.15 million recent (2004-2008) records from MEDLINE, and generated nine different document-document similarity matrices from information extracted from their bibliographic records, including titles, abstracts and subject headings. The nine approaches were comprised of five different analytical techniques with two data sources. The five analytical techniques are cosine similarity using term frequency-inverse document frequency vectors (tf-idf cosine), latent semantic analysis (LSA), topic modeling, and two Poisson-based language models – BM25 and PMRA (PubMed Related Articles). The two data sources were a) MeSH subject headings, and b) words from titles and abstracts. Each similarity matrix was filtered to keep the top-n highest similarities per document and then clustered using a combination of graph layout and average-link clustering. Cluster results from the nine similarity approaches were compared using (1) within-cluster textual coherence based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and (2) two concentration measures based on grant-to-article linkages indexed in MEDLINE. Conclusions PubMed's own related article approach (PMRA) generated the most coherent and most concentrated cluster solution of the nine text-based similarity approaches tested, followed closely by the BM25 approach using titles and abstracts. Approaches using only MeSH subject headings were not competitive with those based on titles and abstracts.},

	abstract = {Search facilitated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods was studied in a collection of Finnish newspaper articles (N = 53,893). To allow quick experiments, clustering was applied to a sample (N = 5,000) that was reduced with principal components analysis. The dendrograms were heuristically cut to ﬁnd an optimal partition, whose clusters were compared with each of the 30 queries to retrieve the best-matching cluster. The fourlevel relevance assessment was collapsed into a binary one by (A) considering all the relevant and (B) only the highly relevant documents relevant, respectively. Single linkage (SL) was the worst method. It created many tiny clusters, and, consequently, searches enabled with it had high precision and low recall. The complete linkage (CL), average linkage (AL), and Ward’s methods (WM) returned reasonably-sized clusters typically of 18–32 documents. Their recall (A: 27–52\%, B: 50–82\%) and precision (A: 83–90\%, B: 18–21\%) was higher than and comparable to those of the SL clusters, respectively. The AL and WM clustering had 1–8\% better effectiveness than nearest neighbor searching (NN), and SL and CL were 1–9\% less efﬁcient that NN. However, the differences were statistically insigniﬁcant. When evaluated with the liberal assessment A, the results suggest that the AL and WM clustering offer better retrieval ability than NN. Assessment B renders the AL and WM clustering better than NN, when recall is considered more important than precision. The results imply that collections in the highly inﬂectional and agglutinative languages, such as Finnish, may be clustered as the collections in English, provided that documents are appropriately preprocessed.},

	abstract = {This article reviews recent research into the use of hierarchic agglomerative clustering methods for document retrieval. After an introduction to the calculation of interdocument similarities and to clustering methods that are appropriate for document clustering, the article discusses algorithms that can be used to allow the implementation of these methods on databases of nontrivial size. The validation of document hierarchies is described using tests based on the theory of random graphs and on empirical characteristics of document collections that are to be clustered. A range of search strategies is available for retrieval from document hierarchies and the results are presented of a series of research projects that have used these strategies to search the clusters resulting from several different types of hierarchic agglomerative clustering method. It is suggested that the complete linkage method is probably the most effective method in terms of retrieval performance; however, it is also difficult to implement in an efficient manner. Other applications of document clustering techniques are discussed briefly; experimental evidence suggests that nearest neighbor clusters, possibly represented as a network model, provide a reasonably efficient and effective means of including interdocument similarity information in document retrieval systems.},
