	abstract = {A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.},

s(i) = ai - bi / (max(ai, bi)), where ai... and bi... .
With silhouettes it is possible to asses the clustering quality without knowing any ground truth or labels. It should be noted that it works better with convex clusters than density based clusters.
It is possible to take average of all silhouette coefficients of objects in acluster and thus calculate "goodness" of a cluster. This can be repeated for whole clustering to get overall average silhouette value.},
